## Good Chatbot Example

### Banking Assistant - Account Management

```
Customer: Hi, I need to check my account balance and also report my card as lost.

Chatbot: I can help with both of those requests. First, let's check your balance. 
Would you like to see your checking or savings account balance?

Customer: Checking account, please.

Chatbot: Your checking account balance is $1,243.65 as of today. 

Now about your lost card - I'll need to verify your identity before proceeding. 
Can you confirm the last four digits of your Social Security Number?

Customer: 5678

Chatbot: Thank you for verifying. I've placed a hold on your card ending in 9012. 
A replacement will be mailed to your address on file (123 Main St) within 3-5 business days.

Is there anything else you need help with today?

Customer: When exactly will it arrive?

Chatbot: Based on current processing times, you should receive your new card by 
Tuesday, April 1st. Would you like me to send you a tracking number when it ships?

Customer: Yes please.

Chatbot: Perfect! I've set up a notification to send you the tracking information
via email. Is there anything else I can assist with today?
```

## Bad Chatbot Example

### Internet Service Provider Support

```
Customer: My internet keeps dropping every 30 minutes or so.

Chatbot: I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with your internet service.
Have you tried restarting your router?

Customer: Yes, I've already restarted it three times today.

Chatbot: Great! Restarting your router often resolves connectivity issues.
Is there anything else I can help you with?

Customer: No, restarting didn't help. I need a different solution.

Chatbot: I understand. Please try unplugging your router for 30 seconds, 
then plugging it back in.

Customer: That's the same as restarting, which I said didn't work.

Chatbot: I'm sorry for the confusion. Would you like me to connect you
with a technical support representative?

Customer: Yes, please.

Chatbot: Please visit our website at support.example.com to schedule a
callback from our technical team. Thank you for contacting us!
